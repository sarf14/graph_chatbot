    Make sure:
    - You use the WEEK() or YEARWEEK() function to group records based on standard calendar weeks.
    - Provide a clear, natural language summary of the weekly totals (e.g., "Week 6 (Feb 5â€“Feb 11): 200 transactions").
    - Ignore any weeks that fall outside February.
    - Use only actual calendar weeks, not custom manual groupings.
    - Base the grouping on the `inserted_on` column, which is of date or datetime type.
    - If asked daywise please use dates for each day of the month individually
